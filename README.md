# Traffic-accident-risk
This work considers combine multi-tricks with highway network to achieve traffic accident risk prediction accurately.  

## MODEL ITEM
### 1. IEEE T-ITS 2023. M2STN: A Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Accident Risk Forecasting [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-flow-prediction/M2TSN)  
* Note that, for the M2STN program, it should be reproduced on the TensorFlow version >= 1.13.1. 
If not, there are some problems will appear in the running stage.

#### NOTICE   
--->>>>>>> M2STN is prepared to summit to journal of IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems TITS.   

Above codes have been uploaded in the Git-Hub page [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-accident-risk).
