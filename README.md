# Traffic-accident-risk
This work considers combining multi-tricks with highway networks to achieve traffic accident risk prediction accurately.  

## MODEL ITEM
### 1. Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies (2024). MG-STNET: A Multi-Graph Spatio-Temporal Network for Traffic Accident Risk Forecasting [[codes link]](https://github.com/zouguojian/Traffic-accident-prediction/tree/main/MG-STNET)  
* Note that, the MG-STNET program, it should be reproduced on the PyTorch version >= 2.10.0. 
If not, there are some problems will appear in the running stage.
